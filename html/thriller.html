      Thriller Film is a genre that revolves around anticipation and suspense. The aim for Thrillers is to keep the<br>
       audience alert and on the edge of their seats. The protagonist in these films is set against a problem – an escape, <br>
       a mission, or a mystery. No matter what sub-genre a Thriller film falls into, it will emphasize the danger that the <br>
       protagonist faces. The tension with the main problem is built on throughout the film and leads to a highly stressful<br>
        climax.<br>
