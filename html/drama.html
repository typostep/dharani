    Drama film is a genre that relies on the emotional and relational development of realistic characters. While Drama film relies<br>
     heavily on this kind of development, dramatic themes play a large role in the plot as well. Often, these dramatic themes are <br>
     taken from intense, real life issues. Whether heroes or heroines are facing a conflict from the outside or a conflict within<br>
      themselves, Drama film aims to tell an honest story of human struggles.<br>
