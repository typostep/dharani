    Movies have been a great source of employment and entertainment ever since they have been invented. However there are <br>
    disadvantages too!!! It always depends on how we humans accept any new inventions. Movies have always been entertaining.<br>
    They have been providing employment to number of people all over the world. They have brought fame to lots and lots of <br>
    people. They have motivated masses in many ways through many films. They have taught a lot of new things to people. They <br>
    led to the growth of channels too!! Sometimes movies can promote false notions as well. They can mislead people especially<br>
    the youth. Hence movies have both pros and cons. It always depends on us to think what has to be accepted and what not to be!!<br>
