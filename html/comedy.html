    Comedy is a genre of film that uses humor as a driving force. The aim of a comedy film is to illicit laughter from the<br>
    audience through entertaining stories and characters. Although the comedy film may take on some serious material, most<br>
     have a happy ending. Comedy film has the tendency to become a hybrid sub-genre because humor can be incorporated into<br>
      many other genres. Comedies are more likely than other films to fall back on the success and popularity of an individual<br>
       star.<br>
